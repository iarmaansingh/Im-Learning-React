This repository contains the code and notes from my React learning process.

## Approach

- **Components**: Examples of functional and class components.
- **JSX**: Writing React components using JSX.
- **Props and State**: How to use props and manage state in React.
- **Hooks**: Learning React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Projects**: Small projects and exercises to apply React knowledge.
